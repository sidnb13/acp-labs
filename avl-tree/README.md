The AVL insertion lab provides an opportunity to implement; 1) a node insertion method, 2) a node deletion method, and 3) a single right rotation.

Submission form to be posted on BLEND.   All submissions should be your original work.

Important points in main.cpp:

- A brief menu is provided that can direct input to the program from 1) stdin or 2) a file.  
    - Input is terminated by an empty line, or the word "END".
    - If you choose to use a file you may provide the name of a different file or simply hit <enter> to accept the default.   The default file includes a small array is provided in "data.txt" that can create a tree for debugging.  
    -    You may create other files for testing.
    -    The format for the data is <operation>:<data>  
        -    The <operation> may be;  
            - A|a - Add the integer value (ex. A: 10)
            - D|d - Delete the value from the tree (ex. d: 10)
- Do not modify the main.cpp file or any of the informational routines in AVLTree.cpp such as; display(), min_level(), max_level(), or inorder().
- Fee free to pull this code into an IDE of you choice.  Anything that supports breakpoints and single step debugging may be helpful.  If you must use an online solution (as needed if you are using a chromebook), I recommend onlinegdb.com.  I have used it and it works well.  There are others that might be worth exploring like codesandbox.com.
